<h1>Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers Version 2.4 Release Candidate 6</h1>
<p><i>Kart Krew Dev &mdash; Mon 13 October 2025</i></p>
<p><em>Dr. Robotnik&rsquo;s Ring Racers</em> version 2.4 is just on the horizon!</p>
<p>This is a <strong>Release Candidate</strong> version; the design and features are mostly final, but since there are a <em>lot</em> of changes in this release, we&rsquo;re making it available in a pending state to check for technical issues and critical bugs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try out the newest features and fixes, and don&rsquo;t mind running into potential bugs, please give this version a try; let us know if you run into trouble via <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/issues">GitLab</a> or on <a href="https://kartkrew.org/discord">Discord</a>.</p>
<p>We want to thank all the dedicated players in our Discord server who have helped rigorously test these pre-release versions and provided valuable feedback so far, and to our community contributors who&rsquo;ve helped fix issues reported by them. This testing period was an incredible success, and the game is all the better for it.</p>
<h1>If you&rsquo;re just arriving, please read the previous release candidate notes first! This page won&rsquo;t list any changes made in prior RC versions.</h1>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There are still more fixes coming! However, we&rsquo;ve already made enough changes that we&rsquo;d like to battle-test the latest stuff while we work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Core Gameplay</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the boost received when spending Rings from a pending Ring payout. The resulting boost will decay much quicker, but reach a much higher peak speed.<ul>
<li>New sounds and effects have been added when boosting from payout.</li>
<li><em>Earlier revisions of 2.4 added this ability, which was useful in a pinch but usually worse for overtaking—which was an unfortunate trap for players used to taping down their Ring button! This levels the uses a bit more; while letting a payout spend naturally will produce more total power, you can use on-demand speed to shake a pursuer or aim for a Sonic Boom.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Race gametypes, crossing the starting line quickly will award a small boost, even if you miss First Blood. You&rsquo;ll also see the timing of your startline cross; adjust your strategy for next time!</li>
<li>First Blood no longer has &ldquo;port priority&rdquo;. Players who cross on the same tic will both receive the same rewards.</li>
<li>You can no longer travel over (most) Tripwires. Players who don&rsquo;t meet the requirements will be knocked away, even if they&rsquo;re visually above the line.<ul>
<li>This doesn&rsquo;t apply to some courses, where signposted and appropriate. Mappers can use the &ldquo;Infinite Midtexture Height&rdquo; flag (Flag 17) to toggle this. </li>
<li><em>To avoid exploits, more and more courses have needed distracting &ldquo;Tripwire walls&rdquo; or aggressive geometry changes. This lets us keep courses readable while keeping cuts honest; many of the offending &ldquo;walls&rdquo; can now be removed.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reduced the prevalence of short Item Roulettes containing mostly Super Ring (bugfix).<ul>
<li><em>We try not to give players attack items when they&rsquo;re too far from other players to use them, but this system was too sensitive in many situations, and often removed strong attacking items with secondary usage effects.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Jawz deployed behind you is significantly faster when it gets moving, and even adapts to your speed if you had been speeding beyond a threshold.<ul>
<li><em>This was always meant to be the intended behavior, a trailing hitbox to ward off opponents! With Snatching added in for good measure, this defensive option&rsquo;s kind of come full circle, huh?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Toxomister triggers Overdrive when draining you to 0 (bugfix).</li>
<li>Toxomister now pays out fewer Amps.<ul>
<li><em>Toxomister can affect more players than any leader item, which gave it disproportionate game-winning rewards if you were able to trap a large group.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stone Shoe&rsquo;s chain has been moderately shortened.<ul>
<li><em>Driving around a Stone Shoe is tricky; the chained player has every incentive to steer into the nearest wall and cut you off. A shorter chain makes it easier to decisively pass, even on corners.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When using Bubble Shield, making wall contact after a bubblebounce will stumble you and drop you out of the air.<ul>
<li><em>This is mostly intended to prevent some strange infinite-speed situations when bubblebouncing into walltransfer setpieces.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significantly increased the range at which the Self-Propelled Bomb enters &ldquo;chase&rdquo; mode.<ul>
<li><em>This should give it more time to decelerate when quickly hurtling towards the leader, reducing unreasonable hits.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interface</h2>
<ul>
<li>Subsonic + Sonic Boom sound effects no longer play when under the effect of Invincibility or Grow.</li>
<li>Sonic Boom no longer appears while in lightsnake.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Subsonic visuals to tint red, as if you were too close to the leader, when actually at a normal distance.</li>
<li>EXP collection sounds now only play for local players.</li>
<li>Bottom-of-screen &ldquo;CHECK&rdquo; warnings appear for players who are significantly farther away.<ul>
<li><em>Ring Racers is a fast game! Advance warning can help you plan for defending a slingshot overtake.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a player is charging Insta-Whip, their &ldquo;CHECK&rdquo; warning will flash white and black. If they&rsquo;re tethering you, their tether will glow white.<ul>
<li><em>Confident players lean on slingshot Whip as a high-reward way to pass. Don&rsquo;t get caught off guard!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When playing with Frantic Items, your EXP total will be shown next to a purple crystal.<ul>
<li><em>EXP is significantly dampened in Frantic games; this is a quick reminder that you&rsquo;re using Frantic odds.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a new Button Display profile for the 8BitDo M30 (original).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Misc Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an oversight preventing leading players from waterskiing.</li>
<li>Fixed players receiving unusual EXP values on the final checkpoint.<ul>
<li><em>This would often be unusually high, but could sometimes be <strong>zero</strong> if you were prevented from finishing.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted checkpoints/finish line areas to adhere to mapping standards in Panic City, Green Hills, Autumn Ring, Roasted Ruins, Bronze Lake and Hydrocity.</li>
<li>Updated various waypoints to adhere to mapping standards in Test Track, Robotnik Coaster, Northern District, Panic City, Sonic Speedway, Green Hills, Angel Island, Obsidian Oasis, Bronze Lake, Sub-Zero Peak, Frozen Production, Hydrocity, Diamond Dust, Blue Mountain 2, Lost Colony, Avant Garden, Bigtime Breakdown, Ice Paradise, Fae Falls, Crispy Canyon, Espresso Lane, Vermilion Vessel, Dragonspire Sewer 2, Coastal Temple, Ramp Park, Advent Angel, Hot Crater, Barren Badlands and Route 1980.</li>

<li>Many more player and skin variables are exposed to Lua. - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/merge_requests/4">!4</a></li>
<li>Hidden ranking applies to all levels in the special round of a Grand Prix cup, rather than just those set as special-compatible - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/merge_requests/31">!31</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<ul>
<li>Disabled flashing cursor animations on the character select screen when Reduce VFX is on - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/merge_requests/50">!50</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixes / Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a severe performance degradation on all Intel-compatible processors when in netgames under specific circumstances - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/issues/283">#283</a><ul>
<li><em>Technical: Intel architecture CPUs implement correct IEEE 754 floating point number behavior with subnormal values (close to 0). The CPU degrades to effectively software-emulating floating point math, causing an enormous performance hit. In essence, if the OS provided very very quiet microphone data to the game, the game would faceplant instantly. This is the default behavior on x86/amd64 and the application must explicitly turn on the &ldquo;Denormals Are Zero&rdquo; and &ldquo;Flush To Zero&rdquo; CPU flags to instead just treat those numbers as zero. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-NOz94ZEOA">Watch this video from LaurieWired if you&rsquo;re curious.</a></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Followers will no longer phase below floor-over-floors when driving on them - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/merge_requests/56">!56</a></li>
<li>If a player switches to spectator mode in a multiplayer Duel Race, the other player will now win the match instead of forcing them to spectate as well - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/merge_requests/52">!52</a></li>
<li>Extra options for the &ldquo;hear tabbed-out&rdquo; (background audio) setting are added to mute voice playback and transmission out-of-focus - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/merge_requests/44">!44</a></li>
<li>The pause menu now shows if Frantic Items is turned on in the current match - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/merge_requests/55">!55</a></li>
<li>Fixed a buffer overflow bug setting the names of bots from Lua - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/merge_requests/38">!38</a></li>
<li>Corrected typo in Profile Edit menu&rsquo;s Accessibility submenu description</li>
<li>Significantly reduced the amount of memory used for certain internal image conversions</li>

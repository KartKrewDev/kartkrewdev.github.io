<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There are still more fixes coming! However, we&rsquo;ve already made enough changes that we&rsquo;d like to battle-test the latest stuff while we work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Core Gameplay</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug preventing EXP from affecting the Item Roulette, and improved overall item odds (and several tuning factors) to compensate.<ul>
<li><em>Yes, really. EXP correctly affected a lot of things, like Top/Shrink availability, Ring Box payouts, and CPU rubberbanding&hellip;but did NOT directly affect the contents of your Item Roulette, giving all players flat odds regardless of their race performance. Congratulations to the players who were able to stage consistent comebacks—it wasn&rsquo;t EXP, you&rsquo;re just good at playing from behind!</em> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced the prevalence of strong speed items when near 1st and far away from pursuers.<ul>
<li><em>Sneakers are strong! This should prevent anticlimactic endings where 2nd place speeds ahead with a Tripwire cut.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dramatically improved the overall strength of Item Boxes when using Frantic Items (more comparable to 2.3).</li>
<li>The final Checkpoint in a race now counts for significant extra EXP.<ul>
<li><em>This rewards frontrunners who can hold their lead to the very end, or inventive racers who can find a last-minute comeback with poor odds. On the average 3-lap course, the finish line is worth about a bonus lap&rsquo;s worth of EXP.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moderately reduced base &ldquo;stun&rdquo; time for lightweight characters.<ul>
<li><em>This adjustment actually applies to all characters below maximum weight, but is most effective on lightweight classes. Stun is also already reduced if you&rsquo;re far from the leader or hit by a map hazard.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ring Bail adjustments:<ul>
<li>You can no longer Ring Bail while a Ring Bail is in progress.</li>
<li>If you respawn for any reason at -20 Rings, you explode (exception: Ring Shooter).
    - <em>This is actually a buff; previously, high-value Ring Bails would leave you stuck in the Bail state with no accumulated ringboost—a death sentence!</em></li>
<li>Ring Bail now correctly removes Rocket Sneakers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Stumble&rdquo; no longer removes ringboost.<ul>
<li><em>This is a change mostly for Bail, since things like Ballhog overcharge could leave you stuck without speed at certain death, but should also make some setpieces less punishing when navigating them under Ring Box effect.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While impervious to damage, significantly reduced hitlag when making contact with hazards, and entirely removed hitlag versus damaging floors.<ul>
<li>Player items inflict a longer, but standardized, amount of hitlag. <em>(This is one of the main counterplay strategies vs. Invincibility / Grow.)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tripwire adjustments:<ul>
<li>The terminology for both approaching &ldquo;TripwireOK&rdquo; and actually reaching it are now called &ldquo;Subsonic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sonic Boom&rdquo; respectively.</li>
<li>Base Sonic Boom threshold increased to 225%.<ul>
<li><em>All of the following changes are meant to make getting a Sonic Boom more readable and accessible from generic speed states, including Ring Box; this unavoidably improves comeback chances, and this compensation nerf is just meant to make attacking the pack (or attacking the lead!) less automatic.</em> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Significantly</em> increased the leniency period when losing a Sonic Boom after already reaching it.</li>
<li>In Race modes, 1st place has a fixed Sonic Boom threshold of 900% speed.<ul>
<li><em>Seek employment.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Offroad no longer increases the Sonic Boom threshold.</li>
<li>When very far from the leader, the Sonic Boom threshold moderately decreases (easier).</li>
<li>Adjusted VFX and added SFX to provide clearer feedback when approaching and reaching the Sonic Boom threshold.</li>
<li>The Subsonic visuals when approaching tripwire threshold now tint red if your Sonic Boom threshold is being raised (too close to leader).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Player afterimages no longer appear when under the effect of only a single boost type.<ul>
<li><em>Players are under near-constant ringboost when playing well, so this was a permanent fixture above a certain skill level and could make it harder to read in crowded areas.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can no longer suffer Ring Sting while you have Rings overhead from an active ringboost. (<em>Reminder: In 2.4, you&rsquo;re also protected from Sting if you&rsquo;re currently attracting rings that would place you above 0, or if you&rsquo;re charging a spindash.</em>)<ul>
<li><em>This prevents frustrating edge-of-vulnerability Stings in the moments between boosting and collecting Rings from the track, or having potential boost wasted because of an unpredictable ricochet.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stone Shoe slows the chained player down significantly more.<ul>
<li><em>Hey, you&rsquo;re, uh. I think you&rsquo;re supposed to chain other people with it. Like it&rsquo;s not supposed to be an advantage to be—are you listening</em></li>
<li><em>(This should make it easier to pass an aggressive chained player without getting wrecked.)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While charging, Lightning Shield is immune to most damage and map hazards.<ul>
<li><em>This brings its functionality in line with the other shields, and restores its defensive power without giving 1st unlimited protection or unreactable attacks.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Teamplay</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Battle mode, items from broken Item Monitors can now be immediately grabbed by anyone on the breaker&rsquo;s team.</li>
<li>In Battle mode, eliminating all members of the enemy team during Overtime will now immediately end the round.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Online Play</h2>
<ul>
<li>Players now gain and lose Mobiums more gradually.</li>
<li>Removed hidden Mobium adjustments for overall race placement.<ul>
<li><em>The final Checkpoint now gives bonus EXP, so this is no longer necessary.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed Mobiums updating strangely in Battle mode.</li>
<li>Raised the bitrate of voice chat (again).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a password to unlock all Tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interface</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the display of signposts when players cross the finish line while about to die - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/merge_requests/28">!28</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<li>Fixed GP placement unlock conditions misfiring entirely - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/issues/253">#253</a></li>
<li>Viewing a non-teamplay replay with teamplay turned on no longer erroneously assigns team colors to players in the replay</li>
<li>Fixed various crashes associated with using &ldquo;local only&rdquo; addons (like sound replacements) during netplay.</li>
<li>Fixed Duels crashing at 99 laps instead of forcibly ending.</li>
<li>Fixed the delay indicator not reflecting your Minimum Input Delay during netplay.</li>

<li>Fixed strange behavior when loading replays with Teamplay enabled in your settings.</li>
<li>Fixed strange screen-fade behavior when playing back replays.</li>
<li>Fixed the <code>debugitemodds</code> command displaying incorrect odds.</li>
<li>Fixed players sometimes receiving an Item Roulette instead of a Casino Roulette when breaking a Ring Box at the same time.</li>
<li>Fixed players under Overshield effect getting hit multiple times by Insta-Whip.</li>
<li>Fixed an exploit regarding Time Attack challenges - <a href="https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/merge_requests/41">!41</a></li>

<blockquote>
<h2>Preliminary patch notes. May be incomplete.</h2>
</blockquote>
<h2>Get Amped!</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Race gametypes, dealing damage to other players grants <strong>Amps</strong>, a backup reserve of electric charge.<ul>
<li><em>In a 4-player game, knocking a single person away can be a big deal: in a 16-player game, it hardly matters at all. Amps normalize the reward for good item play, and give defensive items a bump in power without making the race more chaotic.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you drop to 0 rings, you&rsquo;ll spend your Amps to enter <strong>Overdrive</strong>, briefly shielding you from damage and granting a bonus to top speed, acceleration, and handling.<ul>
<li><em>When going for item hits in chaotic situations, you&rsquo;re often left defenseless afterwards—forced into a tougher situation than the racer you just hit! Overdrive lets you pull away from oncoming danger, and can protect you from combo hits even if your aggression doesn&rsquo;t work out.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overdrive also massively speeds up your ringboost; restock quickly to blast away!</li>
<li>When you&rsquo;re far behind, hitting players close to the front pays out more Amps.</li>
<li>First Blood (crossing the POSITION beam first) now pays out Amps in addition to the boost.<ul>
<li><em>The First Blood boost already has a breakaway effect—it prevents other players from tethering off you—but in courses with early setpieces or tight opening corners, it was often difficult or impossible to apply. The Amp reward lets you get a second shot at dodging early offense, or start stockpiling your resources to hold the lead in the late-game—giving players a more compelling reason to play their POSITION proactively, and giving every race a public enemy #1!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Race, if your item hit sends a player out of bounds, you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with bonus Amps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ring Bail</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tap a single button to spend all of your rings, drop your item, and rapidly boost forward—but reduce yourself to -20 rings!<ul>
<li><em>Insta-Whip and Overdrive are both powerful tools, but needing to spend down to 0 rings often prevented players from accessing them when they were most useful. Ring Bail is a push-button way to unlock high speed and strong offense, making it a great way to push for a checkpoint or quickly course-correct—but at -20 Rings, a single misstep can instantly kill you!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After using Ring Bail, you&rsquo;ll be unable to pick up rings for a <em>long</em> time, and any rings or items you had will be dropped behind you.</li>
<li>While spinning out or tumbling, hold the Bail input for long enough and you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;Burst&rdquo;, cancelling the damage into Ring Bail.</li>
<li>Ring Bail is triggered with the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; button, previously mapped to Ring Shooter. Ring Shooter is now deployed with Bail + E-Brake.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Checkpoints</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most race maps now contain Checkpoints, an extension of &ldquo;Lap Bonus&rdquo; that grades players midway through a lap.</li>
<li>Strong items appear less often by default, but crossing a Checkpoint in high placements awards EXP, boosting your item odds for the rest of the race.<ul>
<li>EXP also affects the payout values from Ring Box.</li>
<li><em>This makes it harder to intentionally play from behind, allows smaller gaps in skill to shine through more often, and limits the &ldquo;crab bucket&rdquo; effect where struggling players drag each other down. Explosive comebacks will be less common, and players who fall behind will need to work their way through the pack rather than relying on power items to immediately cover their mistakes.</em></li>
<li><em>Note: &ldquo;Frantic Items&rdquo; reduces the impact of EXP for struggling players. If you and your play group like roulette-style racing, toggle it on for item odds that are closer to 2.3. (Please only do this if you want a party game!)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Item Boxes no longer spawn until you&rsquo;ve crossed your first Checkpoint.<ul>
<li><em>Everyone has one chance to earn EXP by pure driving, without items to worry about.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checkpoints pay out a small amount of Rings to keep struggling players moving.</li>
<li>When crossing a Checkpoint, you&rsquo;ll see how many seconds ahead or behind you are, as well as whether you&rsquo;re gaining or losing time.<ul>
<li>By default, this displays the leader in Race modes and the closest leading player in Time ATtack. This can be adjusted in HUD Options.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Duel Mode</h2>
<ul>
<li>2-player race matches are now a Checkpoint tug-of-war; take 4 more than your opponent to win!<ul>
<li><em>1v1 is most fun when you&rsquo;re dogfighting with your opponent, pushing each other through every corner—and not very fun when your opponent disappears at POSITION and out-drives you for three minutes. This mode aims to reward active play, reduce last-minute scams, and end the match quickly if someone makes an unrecoverable error.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Duels, the First Blood boost is disabled, but crossing the line first still pays out Amps.</li>
<li>Duels have no maximum lap count; you&rsquo;ll keep racing until someone takes a decisive lead.<ul>
<li>Race for long enough, and &ldquo;Margin Boost&rdquo; will kick in, speeding both players up until one of them falls behind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When playing online, Duel opponents strike maps to determine their next battlefield. Take turns banning maps; the last one standing is played.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Voice Chat</h2>
<ul>
<li>Proximity voice chat is now available! This feature can be configured in the new Voice Options submenu.</li>
<li>Voice chat is opt-in both as a client and for servers.<ul>
<li>The server cvar to control voice chat is <code>voice_servermute</code>.</li>
<li><em>We don&rsquo;t want players or server operators to be caught by surprise, and believe that server operators need to understand the moderation risks of having voice chat active on their servers before turning it on. Be kind to eachother.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proximity effects are turned on by default, and controlled as a server cvar. Server operators may choose to turn off proximity effects if desired.<ul>
<li>The server cvar for this is <code>voice_proximity</code>.</li>
<li>Proximity effects only apply while in a level.</li>
<li>Spectators can only talk outside of levels.</li>
<li><em>A 12-player netgame with several players excited and loud can quickly become overwhelming. Conversely, being able to hear your victims scream in stereo as you drive past them is funny. We think the latter is better as a default.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Servers with voice chat enabled will show up with a microphone icon in the server list.</li>
<li>It is possible to vote-mute a player. The player will remain muted until unmuted by the server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Team Play</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>teamplay</code> cvar enables team scoring in both Race and Battle!<ul>
<li>In Race, earn 2 points for each player you pass and 1 tiebreaker point for 1st place.</li>
<li>In Battle, reach the Score Limit as a team and score a final KO!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bumping your teammates inflicts reduced knockback. In Race, they also won&rsquo;t be hurt by your items or attacks. See &ldquo;Core Gameplay&rdquo; for more!</li>
<li>When using voice chat, you can hear your teammates from farther away.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Core Gameplay</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Neutral Drift&rdquo;:</strong> You now lose less speed while drifting while not steering.</li>
<li><em>Every character&rsquo;s &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; arc is different. Take a smart entry line, and you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with a speedy exit, even without using Rings!</em></li>
<li>The longer you drift, the sharper your inward drift becomes. This effect kicks in faster for characters that build drift sparks faster.</li>
<li><em>This lets heavyweights take better advantage of neutral drift and reduces their reliance on brakedrifting, especially on Gear 2. Try it out on the Joypolis spiral!</em></li>
<li><strong>Global Item Spy:</strong> You can now see a player&rsquo;s held item on their nametag, even outside of Battle mode.<ul>
<li><em>Players threaten vastly different areas of the course depending on their item. The best option was often to avoid them altogether—not very fun for either party. Now, it&rsquo;s easier to get up close and personal, using blind-spots and deadzones to keep the pressure on.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Snatching&rdquo;:</strong> In Race modes, driving into your own missile or trap items now picks them up, placing them back in your item slot. When playing on a team, you can also pick up your teammates&rsquo; items.<ul>
<li>Insta-Whipping a field item will also pick it up.</li>
<li>If your item slot is occupied, you&rsquo;ll hold the item in &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; until it clears out. Picking up another allied item will drop your reserve slot as a paperitem.</li>
<li><em>This makes it less punishing to go for ambitious shots or trap your own line, and affects several intentional-hit momentum exploits.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After starting a sliptide, you can continue sliptiding in a straight line as long as you stay above 100% speed. To end your sliptide early, steer in the opposite direction or start a drift.<ul>
<li><em>This is an input-fairness change for d-pad and keyboard users, allowing them to take the same lines and use the same boost-storage strategies as players using analog sticks. Wavedash charge rate is based on turn strength, so a straight-line sliptide won&rsquo;t grant any credit, but it preserves the special handling state without requiring gate-riding analog inputs or an additional drift.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced wavedash charge rate when sliptiding in both directions (&ldquo;snaking&rdquo;).<ul>
<li><em>Technical: &ldquo;Left&rdquo; and &ldquo;right&rdquo; charge are now counted separately, and a penalty is applied to the lower value. This has the strongest effect on sliptides where your total turn magnitude is similar in both directions—in other words, when you&rsquo;re sliptiding back and forth in a straight line—and has minimal effect on small angle-correction adjustments. We typically like to leave emergent handling techniques untouched (sliptiding itself is a &ldquo;bug made feature&rdquo;), but sliptide snaking was a high-input-intensity, latency-sensitive technique that short-circuited the opportunity cost of the wavedash, alllowing players to gain bonus speed without ever losing it. While you can still lock a full wavedash from Sneaker Panels, you&rsquo;ll typically need to pre-steer to do it.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prepping a wavedash grants you a marginal speed and acceleration boost, as long as you can see the vortex behind you. A larger vortex grants a stronger boost.<ul>
<li><em>Coming from other arcade racers, a surprising amount of people expected sliptiding to work this way, or assumed that it already did! This is a pretty marginal speed buff, but serves as a slight reward for something that was already just flat-out fun to do.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a Ring Box, Super Ring, or other track elements award Rings, you&rsquo;ll now see your pending payout next to your Ring count.</li>
<li>As long as you&rsquo;re getting paid, you can spend Rings from your pending payout at increased speed, awarding a stronger but shorter boost.<ul>
<li><em>We&rsquo;d sometimes see people ask whether it was better to hold Item after picking up a Ring Box. The truth is, in prior versions of the game, it made almost no difference—Rings above your cap of 20 are automatically spent to boost. Now there&rsquo;s a real tradeoff.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Item Roulette no longer uses fixed tables at fixed distance brackets. Your item odds will smoothly change as your position and distance changes, and most reels will have a more consistent level of power.</li>
<li>Most item reels are now signficantly shorter, and a new cue has been added to when a reel &ldquo;loops&rdquo;, allowing you to catch target items on the second go-around.<ul>
<li><em>This is still a deterministic system, but you can no longer memorize specific reels to blind-guarantee specific items; instead, players will need to read their reel as it spins. Also, that reel that contained a single Double Jawz in a sea of Invincibility and Triple Sneakers? Gone. What was that even about?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When far away from other players, the Item Roulette will contain fewer attack-only items.<ul>
<li><em>Attack items will still be present, but the reel will be weighted towards more impactful tools, like speed or trap items.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In lobbies with more racers, item odds become weaker; you&rsquo;ll need to fall further behind before seeing strong items.<ul>
<li><em>This was actually already in the game, but wasn&rsquo;t impactful enough. This should give players time to breathe in larger games, and help thrill-seekers show off their skills on offense—plus, it makes life easier for engine class C, who often had to stay near the pack to keep their pace up.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Damage and respawning no longer reset Item Lockout.<ul>
<li><em>Repeatedly overcharging a Spindash or tapping Ring Shooter could let players quickly combine power items or guzzle thousands of rings. Worse, the mechanic was an invisible knowledge check; when hit near an item set, a novice player would simply drive forward, rather than reversing into the set to try again. In this case, it&rsquo;s better to make the obvious play the right one.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If two players make contact with an Item Box at almost the same time, they&rsquo;ll both receive an item.<ul>
<li><em>In cases where players are nearly tied for an Item Box, it can be hard to guess the outcome. This window of leniency is pretty small, but should reduce situations where a player&rsquo;s reasonable push leaves them out in the cold.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ice physics now make slopes stronger, and mud physics make slopes weaker.<ul>
<li><em>Ice in this game makes your top speed higher, so tall slopes were very easy to climb under ice. This change was especially targeted towards ice slalom sections, such as those in Blue Mountain and Blizzard Peaks Classic, which now guide your kart into the right direction, instead of it being easy to bump the walls. Downhill ice is also even faster now, which is just plain fun!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced handling interference from stepping up/down (&ldquo;stairjank&rdquo;) when traveling at high speed.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Acid Drop&rdquo;:</strong> After being launched from a wall transfer (like &ldquo;quarter pipe&rdquo; set-pieces), you&rsquo;ll see a sparkle effect as you start to descend. If you fastfall while this spark is visible, you won&rsquo;t bounce when you land, converting the speed of your descent into forward momentum.<ul>
<li><em>Most wall-transfer areas were designed before the development of the Fastfall, and it was usually strictly better to take them with a fastfall-tridash combo, causing an awkward break in momentum.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Proration&rdquo;:</strong> Crossing Tripwire without an item now requires more speed when you&rsquo;re near 1st place. Crossing with boost items remains unchanged.<ul>
<li>New VFX and SFX have been added as you approach the speed threshold, and the cotton-candy &ldquo;aura&rdquo; of Tripwire access has been made more visible.</li>
<li><em>Tripwire shortcuts can be crazy strong. Until now, there were tons of ways to take them from strong positons; this skewed up-front interactions that should be about driving skill and space control, and the tenuous balance meant we had to keep 1st place&rsquo;s raw speed in careful check. This opens up some design space for things like the improved Super Ring, while keeping position play focused on fundamental racing.</em> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While moving at Tripwire speed, strong damage types (explosion, tumble) are downgraded, and weak damage types become a brief &ldquo;stumble&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Sneaker Panels no longer grant automatic Tripwire access, but will extend Tripwire access from Sneaker items.<ul>
<li><em>This lets mappers use them more freely without worrying about breaking their shortcuts, and makes races more visually readable near sections with lots of panels.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Stun&rdquo;:</strong> After taking damage, you become briefly &ldquo;Stunned&rdquo; and unable to collect Rings, indicated by circling Flybots over your head. <ul>
<li>Stun lasts longer for lightweights. Stun is <em>much</em> shorter if you&rsquo;re far away from the pack or damaged by a map hazard.</li>
<li><em>Between emergency Spindash, checkpoint awards, and more prevalent Super Rings, it&rsquo;s easier to stay out of Ring Debt than ever, and many damage events put the player back in control much quicker. That can be a bit of a problem for attack items; players with a high Ring count and a good opportunity to tether can go for &ldquo;double attack&rdquo; scenarios, immediately catching up to the player that just damaged them for another shot. Stun still lets you push for a counterattack, but puts you under pressure and weights the odds towards cautious play.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slightly increased the damage radius of Insta-Whip.</li>
<li>If your Insta-Whip doesn&rsquo;t make contact, ring pickup and Insta-Whip charge is disabled for a short period of time.<ul>
<li><em>The &ldquo;zero-ring berserker&rdquo; playstyle was already strong in 2.3, but the standard of offense has raised a bit in 2.4. This aims to make Insta-Whip more forgiving, to match the bigger consequences for missing—and since Amps let you attack with it better, a whiff should let the rest of the lobby breathe, too!</em> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now punt &ldquo;bumper&rdquo; hazards away when you&rsquo;re traveling at high speed or using Grow/Invincibility, like other map hazards.</li>
<li>Slightly improved steering response in Gear 3.</li>
<li>Redistributed stat-based ringboost properties. Base ringboost duration has improved, bonus ringboost duration has decreased, and ringboost <em>speed</em> now considers stats, adding a small bonus that favors class A.</li>
<li>Reduced the power of extreme Ring counts, like from successive Ring Box awards:</li>
<li>Super-strong ringboosts power down faster, even if you&rsquo;re currently getting paid from a Ring Box or other award rings.</li>
<li>You now lose ringboost when falling off the track or lightsnaking, the same as if you&rsquo;d taken damage.</li>
<li>Ring payouts now happen faster when you&rsquo;re already under the effect of a strong ringboost. (This decreases the time you spend in &ldquo;payout mode&rdquo;, which lowers ringboost decay; this is a nerf.)</li>
<li>Ring Box payouts increased by 25%. (This isn&rsquo;t a straightforward buff, but partial compensation for the system-level nerfs.)</li>
<li><em>Stacked Ring Boxes were a powerful (and really goofy-looking) win condition on maps with tight item spacing (and they warped TA into something <em>very</em> strange—stay tuned!). These changes aim to bring outlier stats a little closer to the center when it comes to ring awards, and keep the &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; speed of Ring Box in line with its risk and difficulty.</em></li>
<li>You can now Drop Dash even if you&rsquo;re tumbling or spinning when lightsnake activates.</li>
<li>Gear 1&rsquo;s base speed has increased, but boosts are slightly less effective, and stacked boosts are much less effective.<ul>
<li><em>Gear 1 could be boring on simple layouts when playing well, but still really tough when playing from behind and using multiple boost items—the worst of both worlds! Ring Racers is at its toughest when your speed and handling properties suddenly change; less volatile boosts should make it easier for inexperienced players to stay in control.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maps in Gear 1 will have 75% of their normal lapcount, rounded up.<ul>
<li><em>This only affects maps with lapcounts greater than 3.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Speed Assist</strong>: Players who have been <em>extremely</em> behind for a while receive a small increase to base speed. This bonus speed reduces greatly when boosting, and disappears if they make forward progress.<ul>
<li><em>This increase only starts if a player is substantially behind the bottom 25% of the race, or when they fall extremely behind in Duel. This is not intended to help with overtake progress directly, but helps players who are far away from </em><em>everyone</em><em> and struggling with items rejoin the race.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the Stone Shoe to Race mode! This leader-only trap looks like a dropped Sneaker, but chains the victim to a bouncing boulder, reducing their speed. </li>
<li>Bashing enemies with the Shoe (or tripping them with the chain) inflicts a low tumble, paying out Amps to the chained player <em>and</em> the leader.</li>
<li>Holding Down when activating the Stone Shoe chains it to <em>yourself</em>, instead of setting a trap.</li>
<li>Added Toxomister to Race mode, a leader-only trap that covers passing enemies in clouds of smog. Touching one slows you down and drains your rings, while paying out Amps to the leader!<ul>
<li>Toxic clouds can be blown away by reaching Tripwire speed, even if they&rsquo;re already attached to you.</li>
<li>Toxomister can be destroyed with direct bumps or item shots. If it&rsquo;s not destroyed, the leader can pick it up next lap and redeploy it!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ballhog has been completely redesigned, and is now a multi-function lobbed item.<ul>
<li>Ballhog now starts with 7 shots instead of 5.</li>
<li>Instead of shooting missiles in a fan pattern, lobbed projectiles are tossed in a circle pattern.<ul>
<li>Holding Up will throw the projectiles farther (similar to Proximity Mines), while holding Down will throw them closer to you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While charging, a reticle will appear on the ground showing the expected flight path. These are visible to all players, not just you!</li>
<li>After holding Ballhog at a full charge for 2 seconds, you&rsquo;ll consume your remaining shots to blow yourself up, launching forward in a low tumble.</li>
<li><em>Ballhog has been due for a rework for a while, and we&rsquo;re finally making good on our promise from the 2.2 patch notes! This version is more flexible (and more potent at the right ranges), but no longer shuts down huge areas with little counterplay.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At medium distances, stacks of Super Rings can appear in the Item Roulette. Using a stacked Super Ring pays out all the Rings at once, and pushes you in the direction you&rsquo;re looking.<ul>
<li><em>Amps made all the offensive &ldquo;leader items&rdquo; stronger, so Super Ring needed a tune-up—and inventive frontrunners will definitely get some mileage out of instant thrust! This also gives mid-pack players more options for pure speed, reducing item chaos in a distance bracket previously crammed with exclusively missiles.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Missile items now cause a brief &ldquo;stumble&rdquo; while orbiting, dropped, or thrown backwards, similar to Insta-Whip. Instead of being knocked away, you&rsquo;ll keep traveling in the direction you were already moving.<ul>
<li><em>Going for razor-thin overtakes versus orbital items is cool, and deserves to be less punishing when it doesn&rsquo;t work out. This also gives dedicated trap items a better niche.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sneakers now travel significantly faster, and grant brief invulnerability when used.<ul>
<li><em>In situations where strong Tripwire shortcuts weren&rsquo;t available, Sneakers often felt pretty weak. In 2.4, they sorely needed a tune-up next to offensive items and their Amp rewards.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The elemental shields have been graphically overhauled, and Bubble Shield is now much more visible from a distance.</li>
<li>When set as a trap, Bubble Shield is slightly larger.</li>
<li>Bubble Shield no longer pops in 1st place, but applies extra &ldquo;air drag&rdquo; until you reach a speed cap. This cap starts at 400% and decreases as you approach the leader, visually affecting the shield.<ul>
<li><em>Arbitrary item cutoffs lead to weird player incentives, where people try to hang around near 2nd and time their overtakes. Applying a speed curve, like other high-impact items, means that players will have to make their own choices about when to toss their shield—and normalizes Bubble Shield on courses with steep drops or exploitable slopes.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bubble Shield no longer drops as a trap if it&rsquo;s used to boost. &ldquo;Neutral set&rdquo; (L + no direction) will drop it as a trap, and Down+L will immediately pop it and dash forward.<ul>
<li><em>Bubble Shield&rsquo;s neutral-set behavior was originally a bug, but we decided to keep it, since it provides a lot of linear speed that can sometimes ruin tight lines. This gives it its own niche, preserving Bubble Shield&rsquo;s versatility but lowering its raw power.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dramatically improved handling while traveling at high speed under a Flame Shield boost.</li>
<li>Flame Shield&rsquo;s &ldquo;overheat&rdquo; boost now thrusts you farther.</li>
<li>Lightning Shield now has a &ldquo;charge&rdquo; window when activated, exploding after a delay. While charging, you retain infinite tether range and gain tether speed twice as quickly; after exploding, you&rsquo;ll zip forward.</li>
<li>Lightning Shield no longer hits players who are extremely far above or below you.</li>
<li>Players can no longer trigger their own Proximity Mines by stepping into the detection range. They&rsquo;ll still be affected if another player triggers the mine.</li>
<li>Proximity Mine has a new visual for its activation range.<ul>
<li><em>Did you know Proximity Mine has a higher activation range right as it arms?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing your own Shrink lasers to grant significantly more Grow time than intended.<ul>
<li><em>Players can no longer stack a lap&rsquo;s worth of Grow time from a single Item Box, and will almost always power down after making significant progress. Shrink is supposed to be strong, but was never meant to be this strong!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Landmines can now be thrown forward, sliding along the ground and inflicting a softened Tumble.<ul>
<li><em>Landmine has the weakest defensive profile vs. approaching attackers, so it deserved some bite versus confident overtakes.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can no longer spindash while riding a Garden Top.</li>
<li>When throwing a Garden Top backwards, you&rsquo;ll automatically fastfall.<ul>
<li><em>Garden Top spindashing let players go from a standing start to an instant 400%+, which led to some goofy-looking skips when combined with sloped map geometry.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A &ldquo;shaking&rdquo; Garden Top (near 1st place) will take longer to stabilize when 1st pulls away.</li>
<li>When near 1st place, Grow and Invincibility decay at double speed.<ul>
<li><em>This should make frontrunners safer from high-risk power overtakes—and prevent those overtakes from turning into an even worse frontrun.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Invincibility grants a brief period of Tripwire access after it ends, to make shortcuts more lenient.</li>
<li>Garden Top and Shrink now only appear for trailing players with high EXP.<ul>
<li><em>Both items are intended to propel skilled players forward, but often disrupt the race for no reason if weak players fumble around with them. Players who are consistently struggling are better served by straightforward speed items.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Self-Propelled Bomb no longer hits players immediately after switching targets.</li>
<li>Garden Top and Shrink no longer appear in Gear 1.<ul>
<li><em>Shrink made several setpieces impossible to complete, and Garden Top is simply too volatile for a slower mode.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Battle</h2>
<ul>
<li>The location of the next Combat UFO, and the time until it spawns, is now displayed on the minimap. (blondedradio)<ul>
<li><em>This was never meant to be purely random, but conveyance slipped away during the launch frenzy. With advance warning on the next UFO location, players have big incentives to group up and get fighting!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players can no longer be hit during the visual &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; when grabbing a Power-Up.</li>
<li>Picking up a Power-Up grants longer invincibility, but that invincibility now depletes in the air.</li>
<li>In Battle, Bubble Shield has a 50% longer cooldown, and pops when it deals damage or triggers a clash.<ul>
<li><em>Bubble Shield can still reflect an unlimited number of items&hellip;provided no one attacks you directly, or during the cooldown.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players with an inflated Bubble Shield can no longer suffer Barrier Break.<ul>
<li><em>This fixes a nasty anti-synergy with Mega Barrier. A non-inflated Bubble offers no protection, though!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now inflict Barrier Break on players using Grow, affected by S Monitor, or in other clash/invincibility states.<ul>
<li><em>This previously caused a confusing state where players would appear to suffer Barrier Break, but take no damage.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your Insta-Whip doesn&rsquo;t make contact, Guard and Insta-Whip charge are disabled for a short period of time.<ul>
<li><em>This previously used the standard &ldquo;defense lockout&rdquo; window of 7/10 seconds, but Insta-Whip&rsquo;s half-second duration covered the majority of it, making it difficult to punish reckless whips. Since Whip now steals items on contact, it needed a more targeted weakness.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Last Chance now bounces you upward only once, but you regain control and bounce much further.<ul>
<li><em>Fastfall quick and aim for a reversal, or hang out in the air and try to dodge the followup&hellip;?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Time Attack ver.B</h2>
<ul>
<li>All Time Attack times from prior versions have been invalidated.</li>
<li><em>Don&rsquo;t worry, any medals you&rsquo;ve earned will remain!</em></li>
<li>Several changes made to ringboost mechanics and &ldquo;award rings&rdquo;, to reduce runaway uncapped speed. See &ldquo;Core Gameplay&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Adjusted TA Ring Box payout values and stat scaling to favor heavyweights.<ul>
<li><em>This affects only Time Attack, which already paid out variable amounts for different characters.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TA Ring Boxes pay out more with each checkpoint you cross.<ul>
<li><em>Class-A characters often got to enjoy some dramatic pacing, where their speed would ramp up over the course of a run as they stacked up more and more ringboost. This was fun, so we wanted to give everyone a little of that rising tension.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Time Attack now starts timing the instant your character moves.<ul>
<li>In Time Attack POSITION, added input leniency to Accel+Brake e-braking, preventing three-button Spindash from accidentally moving early.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Time Attack POSITION time shortened slightly, but Spindash charges at 4x speed.</li>
<li>Crossing the starting line in Time Attack now grants the First Blood boost, minus the Amps.<ul>
<li><em>No more rainbow driftboost starts! On the overwhelming majority of courses, a Spindash standing-start is now the fastest way to get going, reducing time spent between resets. You can still adjust your angle before you release, though.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The screen transition when restarting Time Attack is now faster.</li>
<li>After beating your best time, you can no longer quick-restart before reaching the intermission screen.<ul>
<li><em>This prevents players from setting new best times, but exiting before the ghost can save.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Perhaps a more powerful being exists&hellip;?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Massive kudos to everyone who pushed Chao beyond the limits of speed, finesse, and human sanity; the summit of competition has been equal parts awe-inspiring and concerning. Sadly, that level of imbalance isn&rsquo;t fair to those who want to play their favorites—but we&rsquo;ve had a great time watching everyone pull together and break the game one tic at a time. Now let&rsquo;s see what you&rsquo;ve got!</em></p>
<h2>Interface</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the &ldquo;Button Display&rdquo; option when mapping controls. This affects button prompts across the entire game, allowing you to select between modern responsive button prompts, profiles optimized for 6-button reproduction controllers, or 2.3&rsquo;s &ldquo;emulator&rdquo; style control display. When using a keyboard, keyboard keys will be displayed by name where available.</li>
<li><em>Sadly, not everyone grew up playing emulated Genesis games—not everyone has a decade&rsquo;s worth of muscle memory on which shoulder button they mapped &ldquo;Y&rdquo; to. This wasn&rsquo;t easy to implement, but hopefully it can ease some growing pains in the game&rsquo;s opening moments, or for players who frequently switch controllers.</em></li>
<li>During the Tutorial, the Pause screen now shows a control guide.</li>
<li>The Cup and Level Select screens now show more information about unlocked awards and pickups.</li>
<li>The Grand Prix podium screen now shows your difficulty level, and which maps you retried.</li>
<li>During a Tutorial, or in a certain encounter in Grand Prix, the true map name is now shown on the top right of the screen.</li>
<li>The Challenge Board now has subtle coloring to go with each tile&rsquo;s category, to improve navigating through the mountain of rewards.</li>
<li>In Match Race (and Online as a server admin), pressing &ldquo;Action&rdquo; on the Level Select screen now allows you to queue multiple maps for continuous play.<ul>
<li><em>This was already a feature via the Developer Console, but that basically meant it only existed for technical users. A UI like this was always meant to help tournaments and local play run smoothly!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The name of the chosen Follower color will always display when extra information is enabled, even when using Default, Opposite or Match - <a href="https://git.do.srb2.org/KartKrew/RingRacers/-/merge_requests/106">!106</a></li>
<li>Added an on-screen control reminder for Spindash (and boost items) after taking hits with 0 rings, or moving slowly through offroad.<ul>
<li><em>New players make Ring-management mistakes a lot, and when you&rsquo;re panicking your way back onto the road, it&rsquo;s easy to forget you&rsquo;ve got options.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Singleplayer</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instead of &ldquo;tournament points&rdquo;, Grand Prix is now scored by EXP. Play well throughout the race to take the gold!</li>
<li>EXP also replaces Lap Bonus, so Grand Prix ranking criteria has changed; maximum scores and rank thresholds are lower.</li>
<li>Adjusted Grand Prix CPU difficulty to rise slower for struggling players, but fall less when retrying.</li>
<li><em>Struggling players would often &ldquo;fail forward&rdquo; on higher difficulties, ping-ponging between &ldquo;too easy&rdquo; and &ldquo;way too hard&rdquo; as they advanced. Rise to the challenge, or train on a lower difficulty—no boring wars of attrition!</em></li>
<li>Relaxed difficulty Grand Prix no longer uses a lives system, and you can advance even when placing below 4th. You also won&rsquo;t immediately explode if you&rsquo;re guaranteed to place last.</li>
<li><em>Relaxed plays at &ldquo;Gear 1&rdquo; speed, which also received some changes to be more friendly to inexperienced racers: see &ldquo;Core Gameplay&rdquo;.</em></li>
<li>Master difficulty Grand Prix now disables players&rsquo; positive EXP modifiers, making human item odds worse.<ul>
<li><em>Depending on who you asked, Vicious might have been </em><em>harder</em><em> than Master difficulty, since your Rival had an easier time catching up without other strong bots around. Master is a bragging-rights maniac mode for the most devoted players, and we&rsquo;ve tuned it accordingly; with weaker catchup, you&rsquo;ll need both finesse and consistency to win!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Grand Prix, finishing while &ldquo;ring locked&rdquo; from a trailing Self-Propelled Bomb now awards 20 bonus points of Ring Bonus.</li>
<li>Improved CPU racer driving on technical layouts, and made them play more fairly on simple layouts.<ul>
<li>CPUs now slow down more when bumping walls or taking damage from items.</li>
<li>CPUs inflict less knockback, and get bumped farther, when colliding at high speeds (bugfix).</li>
<li>CPUs slow down slightly on long straightaways.</li>
<li>CPUs tether to other CPUs at reduced speed.</li>
<li>Reduced CPU &ldquo;slope resistance&rdquo; (bugfix).<ul>
<li><em>Sneaker Cup was infamous for a reason: CPUs love narrow maps with forgiving guardrails and simple turning. This should make their driving less disruptive.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strong CPUs rubberband less effectively if they&rsquo;re at low EXP.<ul>
<li><em>CPUs get most of their speed from fast driving, not from item play. This change aims to make them feel more like human opponents, making it harder for them to disrupt you when they&rsquo;re consistently struggling.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed CPU &ldquo;turn confirmation&rdquo; state, speeding up their turn response.<ul>
<li><em>CPUs previously had an artificial delay added to their turning, to ensure they didn&rsquo;t rapidly wiggle back and forth in a way that looked unnatural—but when approaching corners from a straightaway, the delayed steering would sometimes make it hard for them to take their preferred line, making them tough to tune.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Map complexity&rdquo; no longer affects CPU speed.<ul>
<li><em>CPU driving is more competent and consistent than prior versions, so they don&rsquo;t need a speed multiplier based on layout anymore. This could occasionally cause problems in addon courses with strange waypoints, and was part of the problem with Chemical Facility.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CPUs have increased grip when taking sharp corners.</li>
<li>Fixed issues with CPU bonus traction that could cause them to reach unusual speeds on certain maps, and adjusted their base speed to compensate.</li>
<li><em>These changes are meant to make CPU racers more consistent and engaging, not necessarily easier. Mid-cup difficulty spikes should be much less drastic, but high AI levels may perform significantly better than you remember.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CPUs are now slightly less effective at using Bubble Shield and Lightning Shield, even at Lv.MAX.<ul>
<li><em>Against skilled human players, quick speed changes can bait them into whiffing their shields; this gives strong CPUs a similar weakness.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved overtake potential and pack breakaway for CPUs favored to win. Packs of CPU racers are more likely to spread out in all gamemodes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could rarely cause CPU racers to reach impossibly high difficulty on Relaxed mode.</li>
<li>Significantly raised requirements to enter a certain encounter. <ul>
<li><em>Players shouldn&rsquo;t feel pushed into difficult encounters before they&rsquo;re totally comfortable with what&rsquo;s on offer. Enjoy racing and hone your skills, without the shadow of a certain adversary—but when you&rsquo;re ready&hellip;!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In a certain encounter, lowered the speed threshold required to deal damage or pass Tripwire.<ul>
<li><em>This allows Super Ring to be used offensively, and opens up damage opportunities on a number of short inclines.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed the appearance of a certain foe as damage is inflicted.</li>
<li>When retrying a certain encounter, reduced &ldquo;carryover damage&rdquo; from repeated attempts. Carryover damage is disabled entirely on Master difficulty.<ul>
<li><em>To some people, this might be a surprising nerf, but for everyone dumping Orbinauts on the first slope in A*******, you might have seen it coming.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Online</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue preventing players from accessing the Server Browser after disconnecting from a modded netgame.<ul>
<li><em>You&rsquo;ll still need to restart the game to join a new server, but rejoining the server you were just on should work fine.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In sessions where there are not enough player slots for all the players connected, the NO CONTESTed player will become a spectator and be replaced by one of the spectators. This is controlled by the cvar <code>shuffleloser</code> and is enabled by default.<ul>
<li><em>Try setting &ldquo;Max Players&rdquo; to 2, then &ldquo;Max Connections&rdquo; to something higher, for a rotating lobby in the new Duel mode.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve been waiting for a while after finishing a round, the tally screen will transition to a spectator view if there are still players to watch.</li>
<li>Improved compatibility with certain VPN software or strange home networks. When you connect with an unusual IP, you&rsquo;ll connect as a GUEST instead of crashing.<ul>
<li><em>The RRID system checks the server&rsquo;s IP to prevent certain kinds of impersonation. These checks are disabled on a physical LAN, but there&rsquo;s no way to tell how weird VPN software will remap private IP space; this is the next best thing.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed the ability to join in-progress races during the first 20 seconds.<ul>
<li><em>This caused replay desyncs we weren&rsquo;t able to resolve, and is a nasty edge case for addon authors besides. Sorry!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significantly improved the speed of file checks and the HTTP downloader, making it easier to join Modded games. (Hanicef, alufolie91, Indev)</li>
<li>Fixed &ldquo;server verification failed&rdquo; errors when waiting for a long time to join a full server.</li>
<li>The new &ldquo;Mobiums&rdquo; rating system replaces PWR.LV. This system is more forgiving at low ratings and less volatile in general.<ul>
<li><em>PWR.LV is a zero-sum system: if you gain points, someone else has to lose points in return. This meant that a room&rsquo;s maximum rating had a hard maximum: the number of players who had &ldquo;donated&rdquo; their starting 1000 PWR to stronger players. It&rsquo;s now much harder to drain away all of your rating, and modestly successful players should sustain higher ratings, but the top end of the scale still demands consistency vs. strong players. Try the Auto Gear and Auto Encore settings to spice things up for high-rated rooms!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players who disconnect or spectate mid-round will now forfeit some Mobiums (previously PWR.LV), unless they were in the lead.<ul>
<li><em>Forfeit penalties have existed in the code since 2.0, but were never triggered thanks to a small oversight. Whoops.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>A new challenge for a new unlockable character has been added! Sounds like trouble&rsquo;s brewing&hellip;</li>
<li>Additional challenges for new unlockable followers have also been added!</li>
<li>An additional Battle Course has been added as a bonus for clearing the Tutorial Challenge.</li>
<li>Once you&rsquo;ve collected every Spray Can, all uncollected locations will become &ldquo;KKD Medals&rdquo; available for bragging rights.<ul>
<li><em>A common refrain among those who really got into finding Spray Cans is &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over already??&rdquo; We always wanted a way to continue the hunt for those who loved the puzzle just as much as the reward, but it required a little extra engineering to put in place. With the luxury of post-launch support, this expanded exploration is finally here!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjusted some calculations for the at-a-glance info on the Challenge Board.<ul>
<li>The brightness of each pixel in the scroll bar above the Board</li>
<li>The fill percentage of the Chao Medal in the top right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pulseman&rsquo;s unlock condition no longer requires being in Grand Prix, but now also requires an A rank.</li>
<li>In addition to its existing unlock condition, Test Run can now also be unlocked by loading an addon.</li>
<li>Removed a stray comma in Tridentz&rsquo; description.</li>
<li>Marble Foyer, Speed Highway, Cyber Arena, Chaos Chute, Daytona Speedway, Thunder Piston and Fae Falls have new unlockable Alternate Music tracks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessibility + Quality of Life</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added &ldquo;CPU&rdquo; indicators above CPU players.</li>
<li>Raised the chase camera on &ldquo;flat&rdquo; maps, like MEGA Cup, to improve forward visibility.</li>
<li>Looking backwards now adjusts the camera&rsquo;s momentum and distance, making the effect instant and hopefully reducing motion sickness. - <a href="https://git.do.srb2.org/KartKrew/RingRacers/-/merge_requests/45">!45</a></li>
<li>You can now skip through the SEGA logo (to the disclaimer) faster. - <a href="https://git.do.srb2.org/KartKrew/RingRacers/-/merge_requests/26">!26</a></li>
<li>Votes are now logged to the server host&rsquo;s chat, including the name of the calling player. This allows hosts to take action against players abusing the vote system.</li>
<li>Added the &ldquo;Strict Fastfall&rdquo; profile option. When enabled, the E-Brake button combo will never cause you to fastfall, requiring you to press your Spindash input instead.<ul>
<li><em>This is normally the sort of control option we avoid, but in corner cases involving unexpected airtime or lag spikes, the input-overlap between brakedrifting and fastfalling could be hard to bear.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a 5-second rewind in Egg TV playback, for finer control than the &ldquo;Restart&rdquo; option.<ul>
<li><em>The extremely granular Rewind option in SRB2Kart was devastatingly buggy and had to be disabled for Ring Racers&rsquo; launch, but it was pretty dull to get the exact clip you wanted with only a total restart for stepping back. Hopefully this coarse tool fills the need without any of the headache!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When playing alone, you can immeditely update the Character, Follower, or Color on your current Profile from the Challenge Board.</li>
<li>The game will now remember the last display it was on, and restores it on start-up.</li>
<li>Three similarily named Developer Console commands are now a suite of closely related utilities, accepting almost the same argument format and differing primarily in output.<ul>
<li><code>map</code> is for immediately switching to a Course.<ul>
<li>As the standard-bearer, its parameters are largely unchanged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>queuemap</code> is for interacting with the Round Queue, the active collection of Courses.<ul>
<li>Added <code>-show</code>/<code>-s</code>.<ul>
<li>Reveals the next Round in the queue via server shout message</li>
<li>Can be used manually, or with <code>automate</code> commands for tournament rulesets that permit foreknowledge of the next Round without requiring the host needing to constantly work off memory or document</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>-clear</code> now also supports the partial parameter <code>-c</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>showmap</code> is for printing information about a Course.<ul>
<li>Added the ability to provide partial names (or full lumpnames/IDs) to identify Courses without going to them.<ul>
<li><code>showmap robo</code> will preview you the Course <code>map robo</code> or <code>queuemap robo</code> would have resolved to!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added <code>-gametype</code>/<code>-gt</code>/<code>-g</code>.<ul>
<li>Matches the other two&rsquo;s accepted parameters</li>
<li>Can be used for checking compatibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All three now support <code>-random</code> (or <code>-r</code>).<ul>
<li>Can be combined with <code>-gametype</code>/<code>-gt</code> in all contexts, otherwise uses the current active gametype (or fails on menu)</li>
<li><code>randommap</code> has been deprecated, and will now only print the replacement instruction <code>map -random</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>The Developer Console isn&rsquo;t really intended for end users, but it&rsquo;s essential for server management. Minor increases in utilities utility can go a long way in the right hands!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Level images are displayed again for Discord Rich Presence.<ul>
<li><em>These were originally omitted because we ran out of image space on the Discord application, which was extremely unfortunate because it made the feature a lot less useful. But, we discovered that there&rsquo;s an undocumented feature where you can self-host your own images instead to bypass said limits, so they&rsquo;re back now!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Reduce Effects&rdquo; now removes:<ul>
<li>Palette flashes - <a href="https://git.do.srb2.org/KartKrew/RingRacers/-/merge_requests/48">!48</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;Prize&rdquo; flickering on the Cup select - <a href="https://git.do.srb2.org/KartKrew/RingRacers/-/merge_requests/76">!76</a></li>
<li>Spray Can/Super Flicky flare flickering - <a href="https://git.do.srb2.org/KartKrew/RingRacers/-/merge_requests/76">!76</a></li>
<li>Flashing on not-yet-unlocked Characters in replay playback - <a href="https://git.do.srb2.org/KartKrew/RingRacers/-/merge_requests/138">!138</a></li>
<li>Ring Sting VFX jittering - <a href="https://git.do.srb2.org/KartKrew/RingRacers/-/merge_requests/137">!137</a></li>
<li>Teleporter animations in Tutorial maps</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Texture animations can now be overridden for Reduce Effects using <code>RVFXANIM</code> lumps. These are considered non-modifying so they can be adjusted locally, like music - <a href="https://git.do.srb2.org/KartKrew/RingRacers/-/merge_requests/135">!135</a><ul>
<li>Several base-game animated textures known to be problematic for photosensitive players have either reduced or completely stopped animation speed with Reduce Effects enabled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a 1-tic delay in handling response when playing online or using the Minimum Input Delay option.</li>
<li>Fixed minor input pacing problems when your network delay was below your Minimum Input Delay.</li>
<li>Fixed mass desync during Battle overtime.</li>
<li>Fixed many unintuitive slope launches. This is a core physics fix that prevents you from launching off of shallow grade slope transitions.</li>
<li>Fixed sliptides failing to start in certain netgame conditions, or while turning with Lite Steer.</li>
<li>Fixed unusual respawn behavior when dying after faulting, or while affected by certain map gimmicks.</li>
<li>Fixed strange Eggmark pass behavior when passing to a player already rolling an Eggmark roulette.</li>
<li>Fixed &ldquo;invisible shield&rdquo; behavior when obtaining an elemental shield while buffering Ring usage.</li>
<li><em>In situations where you can grab a shield without pressing the Item button, like timing out a roulette or picking up a capsule, you&rsquo;ll still be able to buffer rings—but the shield won&rsquo;t appear, and won&rsquo;t protect you, until you release the button. Shields protect the holder from Ring Sting, and the holder could always react to pressure and reactivate the shield, so this tactic was difficult to play against!</em></li>
<li>Fixed turbines and ice cubes cutting certain boosts short.</li>
<li>Fixed clouds resetting your drift on contact.</li>
<li>Fixed unusual collision behavior when triggering a Ball Switch with an inflated Bubble Shield.</li>

<h2>Modding</h2>
<p>Please see the merge requests for details on new Lua functionality exposed; some are just too much to detail here!</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the <code>MODINFO</code> lump. This is a standardized way for addon authors to add name, author info, external links, and required game version to their addon, as well as a (currently unused) icon.</li>
<li>The same KKD Medals that permit the Spray Can hunt to continue in base-game Race Courses will appear in custom ones where Spray Cans previously failed to appear.</li>
<li><code>K_AddMessage</code>, <code>K_ClearPersistentMessages</code>, and their player-specific equivalents (as seen in Battle and Tutorial) are now exposed for Lua scripters&rsquo; use. - <a href="https://git.do.srb2.org/KartKrew/RingRacers/-/merge_requests/9">!9</a></li>
